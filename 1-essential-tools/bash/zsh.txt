ZSH - Git:
#g is a handy alias for git. This means you can type things like g clone <whatever> instead of git clone <whatever>. Might only be two keystrokes, but they soon add up.
#gaa is an alias for git add all. I use this one all the time.
#gb is an alias for git branch, which will list all of the branches in the current repo and show you which one you’re on.
#gcb is an alias for git checkout -b, the command that allows you to create a new branch.
#gcm is an alias for git checkout master. This returns you to the master branch.
#gdca is an alias for git diff --cached. This allows you to diff any files you’ve staged for commit.
#gf is an alias for git fetch.
#gm is an alias for git merge.
#gp is an alias for git push. To sync a fork of a repo, you could do: gf upstream, gm upstream/master, followed by gp.
#glog is an alias for git log --oneline --decorate --graph, which will give you a pretty git branch graph.
