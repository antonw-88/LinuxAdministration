This repo was initially used for storing various commands/processes for setting up a new system/various troubleshooting processes etc. I then reorganized it to function as a study FAQ for the RHCSA certificate. While the focus will be Red Hat based, this guide is intended to be usable for someone who is new to Linux and in the process of learning how the Linux Distros function in general; the difference between Red Hat and Debian and Arch and Gentoo etc, are in the end relatively small when compared to their similarities.  
The structure of the repo is based on Red Hat's overview of the contents that the certificate validates that the holder has a good understanding regarding.[1] The various sections are described below.
